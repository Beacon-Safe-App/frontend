## About The Project
This project was started as a Capstone submission for General Assembly Software Engineering Intensive. Much of what is represented in this iteration is placeholder material and meant to be seen as a soft prototype. The intention is to build off of this to ultimately create a functional mobile app that is accessible to the general public.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by many existing platforms, namely:

1. The ACLU's Mobile Justice/Police Encounter app which allows users to record interactions with law enforcement, report civil rights violations, and receive information on legal rights and resources

2. Brooklyn-based Hollaback!/Right To Be: an app designed to help users document and report harassment, provide resources for addressing and preventing harassment, and connect users with support networks

3. Tech 4 Good's 'Circle of 6' app which focuses on preventing violence and promoting safety by allowing users to quickly alert their trusted contacts in case of an emergency

4. Colin Kaepernick's 'Know Your Rights Camp' organization and app that provides users with information on their legal rights, resources for various situations, and tools to assist with navigating interactions with law enforcement

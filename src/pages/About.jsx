      <h3>SUSTAINABILITY AND FUNDING</h3>
      <p>
        This project is self-funded and managed through the nonprofit
        organization Beacon Safe Incorporated, established by Pepper
        Rostamizadeh.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
      <p>
        Inspired by lived experience, this application seeks to support crime
        victims in large, densely-populated cities.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>The intention is to provide tools, documentation and resources
        to empower victims, and to allow the user to decide if, when and how
        they seek intervention and recourse and from whom, with the ability to
        prioritize community and personal contact intervention over police and
        law enforcement, if they so choose.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>This project was inspired by many existing platforms, namely:
